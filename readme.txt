Gives you the ability to turn comments and pings on or off for individual attachment pages within your media library.

== Description ==

Just like regular posts and pages, attachments have their own [pages](http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Image_and_File_Attachments#Inserting_Images) where guests can leave comments (and can also accept trackbacks/pingbacks).  Unlike regular posts and pages, attachment pages don't offer any UI controls that let you choose (on an individual basis) which attachment pages should allow comments and pings.

This plugin corrects this issue by giving you the ability to turn comments and pings on or off for individual attachment pages within your media library.

The global setting to allow comments or pings by default already applies to attachment pages.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `attachment-page-comment-control/` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
